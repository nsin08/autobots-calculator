## PO Decision: Option C - Phased Delivery Approved ✅

@tech-lead - Thanks for the detailed analysis. I choose **Option C: Phased Delivery (2 sprints)**.

**Rationale:**
- Gets internal MVP in hands faster (3 weeks for validation)
- Maintains quality with full 166 hours
- Allows early feedback before completing all features
- Aligns with "production-grade path" - build it right from start

**Approved Plan:**

### Sprint 1: v0.3.0-alpha (Internal Testing) - 3 weeks, 120 hours
✅ **Deliver:**
- User management (register/login/logout)
- Basic calculation history (no pagination, last 50)
- EMI calculator (most critical financial tool)
- Core tests (85% coverage minimum)

✅ **Success Criteria:**
- Internal team can register, login, calculate EMI, view history
- Core user flows tested and working
- Ready for internal feedback

### Sprint 2: v0.3.0-final (Public Release) - 2 weeks, 46 hours
✅ **Deliver:**
- Simple Interest calculator
- Compound Interest calculator  
- History pagination
- Improve test coverage to >90%
- Full QA testing (cross-browser, responsive)
- Bug fixes from Sprint 1 feedback

✅ **Success Criteria:**
- All 3 financial calculators working
- Full feature set from original Epic
- Production-ready quality

**Timeline:**
- Sprint 1 complete: ~Late January 2026
- Sprint 2 complete: ~Mid February 2026
- Total: 5 weeks

**Budget:** 166 hours approved ✅

**Validation Point:** After Sprint 1, we'll assess:
- Is EMI calculator meeting user needs?
- Any UX issues with history feature?
- Need to adjust Sprint 2 scope?
